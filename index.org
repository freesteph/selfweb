Hi. My name is Stéphane.

It’s pronounced “Stefan”. Not “Stéphanie”. I get that the é is
disturbing but it’s just the French spelling. If you want to type it
on a Mac, you have to go ~Alt + e~, then e again. If you want to type it
on a phone, you long-press the e key.

+I live in London and I’m a software engineer+ I live in Paris nowadays.

I try and maintain a blog and you can always [[mailto:stephane.maniaci@gmail.com][e-mail me]]. Maybe.
