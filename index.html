        <p>So just because I graduated in Computer Sciences doesn't
          mean I code everyday from my basement or that I dream binary.</p>

        <p>But I do like coding. Not only because it helps me enjoy
          problem-solving, but also because it is one of those activites
          that grabs my full attention, drives all of my focus toward
          one ultimate goal: <strong>you</strong>.</p>

        <p>I care about details. The best hope I have for whatever
          comes out of my keyboard is that it will fullfil its mission,
          improve the current situation and give you pleasure to work
          with. I want the world to stop thinking of computers as a
          source of frustration.</p>
