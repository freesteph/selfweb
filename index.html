      <h3>Life</h3>
      <p>I was born the same day as Julius Caesar, but because of
      unfortunate circumstances I haven't conquered Italy yet, however
      I do share the special habit of walking half-naked in my house.

      <p>As a kid I successively dreamed about becoming a Formula One
      pilot, an inventor, a masseur and a rock-star.</p>

      <p>Apart from the rock star part which I am currently working
      on, I was able to achieve a part of each of those dreams in my
      daily developer duty, designing and building systems that will
      make people's life easier.</p>

      <p>I love the Beatles.</p>
