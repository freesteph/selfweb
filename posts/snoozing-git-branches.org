#+TITLE: Snoozing git branches: a naming strategy
#+DATE: <2024-01-09 Tue>

I rely on Git a lot to get my work done and organise the work that I
can't actually get to "done".

I sometimes have proof-of-concept code that I just don't want to
throw away, things that can't be prioritised now but will make
excellent candidates for rainy-days-refactors or good guidance when
the feature/thing is actually needed.

These bits of code will usually end up in branches, out-of-date but
rebaseable branches, but will pollute my git-branch listing.

The solution I've found is fairly simple and cute, so I thought I'd
share it here: prefix your branch name with ~zzz/~. It equally
leverages the fact that ~git branch~ is sorted alphabetically and also
indicates the work is snoozed. Smart, uh?
