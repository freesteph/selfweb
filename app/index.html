        <h3>tl&dr</h3>
        <p>I am Stéphane (pronounced Stéphane), I play guitar and
        computer keyboards. I was born and raised in Montpellier,
        southern France, but currently reside in London. I pay for my
        Nutella by doing web and mobile development.</p>

        <h3>Story of my life</h3>
        <p>I was born at some point in 1990, and I don't regret my
        decision. I grew up in Montpellier, got a Computer Sciences BS
        (as in: Bachelor of Sciences) and then real life started.</p>

        <p>I did some open-source work with GNOME for a little while,
        and somehow this got me an internship in San Mateo, California
        with the awesome people at Fanhattan. I mean, when I was there
        they were awesome. I don't know now. They probably still are,
        but you never know.</p>

        <p>Then I got back to France and I got a job in Paris with
        Plizy. It was a lot of fun and buttery croissants, but then
        they decided to move to San Francisco, California, so I
        grabbed my suitcase, tried to grow a beard, and moved there as
        well. And I got a fixie.</p>

        <p><span class="date">sept 2013</span>I moved on to
        Spinlister/Liquid, wonderful team, great project, stupid
        visa. Had to retreat to France after two months, because I was
        just an "authorized alien" in the US. Give me your tired, your
        poor, but come back in two years.</p>

        <p>I played sleeping contests with my cat back in
        Montpellier.</p>

        <p><span class="date">march 2013</span>I moved to London and
        joined the team at Lyst. I was in charge of web development,
        but something was wrong in the equation and I was free again
        after two months. Learned a tremendous amount of stuff
        there. Did you know that dolphins can group-rape other
        dolphins? Me neither. And also Javascript code (it doesn't
        *have* to be ugly) and Django magic.</p>
